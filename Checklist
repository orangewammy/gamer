1) Follow the "creating accounts" tutorial: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2liJsHOJcfw&list=PLtV8GdR6k9t9tBuHS8CP2d356Qjc1vbeP&index=16
2) Add extra <input> elements (instead of just username and password)
  You can add radio buttons using <input type="radio"> -- see example: https://www.w3schools.com/tags/tryit.asp?filename=tryhtml5_input_type_radio

3) Inside your create_account_post function, try doing print(request.form)
  --Can you tell which radio button the user has clicked?

4) Change the user dictionary within the create_account_post function, so that it ALSO saves their favourite genre etc
 (ie: so it saves the answers to each radio button group)






5) Look at your code for the index function (the home page).
  Notice how it prints all the posts?
  Now, make ANOTHER function in ANOTHER app.route that prints all the USERS
  Tip: You will need to make another template, like mainpage.html
